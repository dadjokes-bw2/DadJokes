            <h2>Lift Off</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
                marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
                delicate,
                that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>

            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a
                globe,
                having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>

            <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as
                equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

                <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>

                <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy
                    relic.
                    The Earth was absolutely round.</p>

                <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one
                    eye,
                    and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
